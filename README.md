# Pedal Forecast

A React application was created using Vite, which currently displays the latest weather information for an entered location name. This is achieved using the OpenWeatherMap API.
Hosted using Azure Static Web Apps: https://salmon-glacier-049c25803.4.azurestaticapps.net/

The project will be updated to include information relevant to cycling safety and performance.
